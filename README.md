# The Thousand Sunny

## DISCLAIMER
This website contains spoiler images from the anime One Piece.
Furthermore, I chose One Piece to model this website after because it is one of the
most popular anime of all time, and I thought I would easily find copyright free
images and videos. There is no other reason why I chose One Piece. 

Hope you like the webpage!

## Description

This project is a webpage created using a template from the Odin Project's first
project given to students. I will be somewhat following the template, but I have
already done the original project so this one is to push what the Odin Project has not
yet shown students. The theme of this page is the crew of the Thousand Sunny
from the anime One Piece.

If you want to see the original project from the Odin Project to see what the general
template given looks like, I created it here:
