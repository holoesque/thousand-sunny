# The Thousand Sunny

This project is a webpage created using a template from the Odin Project's first
project given to students. I will be somewhat following the template, but I have
already done the original project so this one is to push what the Odin Project has not
yet shown students. The theme of this page is the crew of the Thousand Sunny
from the anime One Piece.

If you want to see the original project from the Odin Project to see what the general
template given looks like, I created it here:
